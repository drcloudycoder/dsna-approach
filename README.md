*Work in progress here*

### Current Approach

For each data structure, I am currently doing the following -
1. Implement the basic operations of the data structure [here](https://github.com/drcloudycoder/ds)
2. Solve "Easy" tagged questions on Leetcode/Hackerrank to get a hang of topic and common questions
3. Solve related questions from the book [Cracking the Coding Interview ](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0/134-3677748-5985346?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=QXWS9J4GNM9RP7HD0HVQ) in [here](https://github.com/drcloudycoder/ctci)


### Resources

Here are some of the resources I am currently using -

1. [Hackerrank Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOf7UPMHBjAavgD0Qw5q5ww/videos?sort=dd&shelf_id=0&view=0) (Short and easy to understand video for each data structure)
2. [Geeksforgeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/) (Just the theory part in case above does not clear up something)
